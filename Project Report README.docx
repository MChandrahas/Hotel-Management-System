Conclusion & Recommendations: 
This project “Hotel Management System” has a benefit of managing the employees incase the had forgotten their password or if they had quit their job the admin can disable their account. We recommend you not to loose the Login Id and password for the application since it cannot be reset. The login id is “hms” and the password is “admin” .
Future Scope: 
This application has a very high future scope and it can be developed even further bu adding some more features depending on the hotel like room service etc.
